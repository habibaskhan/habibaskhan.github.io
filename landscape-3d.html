     In previous years San Jose's crime rate has been below the California and U.S. averages.
     Last year, however, San Jose's crime rates increased 3% above the California average,
     and almost 1% above U.S. average. This 3-D model has a base with “blocks” of differing shapes and sizes; each 
     “block” is stacked one after another. The differing heights of the blocks reflect the
      crime rates in San Jose; the highest block (on the very top) is where crime happens 
      most often.

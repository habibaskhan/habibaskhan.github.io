     	Technology is a very important privilege in our lives today.I believe that it's so important that 
     even if there is a natural disaster, whether it be an earthquake, tsunami, hurricane, 
     tornado, etc., people will be slower to jump into action. I think more people will try to get it on camera than 
     those who will actually be focusing on the current events and trying to survive. This is an 
     over-exaggerated image of what might happen if there was a massive 'Hollywood-style' tidal
     wave looming over San Francisco.

     <h3>Technology is very important in today's society. 
     We use it to stay connected, not onlyÂ to each other but the entire world. 
     I believe that unfortunately, people have become too attached to technology 
     and prioritize it in such a way that they forget other things.
     As if it's a distraction that keeps them from staying focused.</h3>
